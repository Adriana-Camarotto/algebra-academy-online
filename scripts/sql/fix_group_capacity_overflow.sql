-- Fix Group Session Capacity Overflow
-- This script removes excess bookings for group sessions, keeping only the first 4 bookings per slot
-- Run this to fix the issue where more than 4 students were allowed to book the same group session

-- üîç First, let's see which group sessions have more than 4 bookings
SELECT 
    lesson_date,
    lesson_day, 
    lesson_time,
    service_type,
    COUNT(*) as booking_count
FROM bookings 
WHERE service_type = 'group' 
    AND status IN ('scheduled', 'pending')
    AND payment_status IN ('pending', 'paid')
GROUP BY lesson_date, lesson_day, lesson_time, service_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
ORDER BY lesson_date, lesson_day, lesson_time;

-- üö® BACKUP: Create a backup of affected bookings before deletion
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bookings_overflow_backup AS
