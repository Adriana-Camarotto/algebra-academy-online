# Admin/Tutor Automatic Refund System

## üìã Overview

This system extends the existing payment architecture to automatically process refunds when administrators or tutors delete bookings within the 24-hour payment window. This ensures students are automatically refunded when lessons are cancelled by the academy rather than by the student.

## üéØ Key Features

### Automatic Refund Logic

- **Payment Window Detection**: Automatically detects if a booking deletion occurs within 24 hours before the lesson
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Only admin and tutor roles can delete bookings
- **Automatic Stripe Refunds**: Processes real Stripe refunds when conditions are met
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Logs all admin deletions with refund status for transparency

### Refund Conditions

A booking deletion will trigger an automatic refund if:

1. ‚úÖ **User Role**: Deleting user is admin or tutor
2. ‚úÖ **Timing**: Current time is within 24 hours before lesson start
3. ‚úÖ **Payment Status**: Booking payment status is "paid" or "completed"
4. ‚úÖ **Booking Status**: Booking is not already cancelled

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Components Updated

#### 1. New Edge Function: `admin-delete-booking`

**File**: `supabase/functions/admin-delete-booking/index.ts`

**Key Features**:

- Role validation (admin/tutor only)
- 24-hour payment window calculation
- Automatic Stripe refund processing
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Graceful error handling

**API Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Agendamento deletado com sucesso e reembolso processado automaticamente",
  "automatic_refund_processed": true,
  "refund_id": "re_1234567890",
  "within_payment_window": true
}
```

#### 2. Payment Utils Extension

**File**: `src/utils/paymentUtils.ts`

**New Function**: `adminDeleteBooking()`

- Calls the admin-delete-booking Edge function

#### 3. Admin UI Enhancement

**File**: `src/pages/AdminBookingsPage.tsx`

**Improvements**:

- Enhanced delete confirmation dialog showing refund status

### Database Schema

#### Enhanced Payment Logs

```sql
ALTER TABLE payment_logs
ADD COLUMN stripe_response JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

**Admin Deletion Audit Fields**:

```json
{
  "admin_deletion": true,
  "admin_user_id": "uuid",
  "admin_role": "admin|tutor",
  "within_payment_window": true,
  "refund_processed": true,
  "refund_id": "re_1234567890",
  "deletion_timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### New Database Functions

**`check_admin_deletion_refund_eligibility()`**

- Calculates refund eligibility based on lesson timing
- Returns comprehensive eligibility analysis
- Used for both processing and reporting

**`get_admin_deletion_stats()`**

- Provides statistical overview of admin deletions
- Tracks refund rates and amounts
- Supports custom date ranges

#### Admin Deletion Summary View

```sql
CREATE VIEW admin_deletion_summary AS
SELECT
    booking_id,
    admin_user_id,
    admin_role,
    within_payment_window,
    refund_processed,
    stripe_refund_id,
    deletion_timestamp,
    amount
FROM payment_logs
WHERE status IN ('admin_deleted', 'admin_deleted_refunded');
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Admin Dashboard Deletion

```typescript
const result = await adminDeleteBooking(bookingId, "en");

if (result.success) {
  console.log("Deletion successful:", result.message);

  if (result.automaticRefundProcessed) {
    console.log("Automatic refund processed:", result.refundId);
  }
}
```

### Check Refund Eligibility (SQL)

```sql
SELECT check_admin_deletion_refund_eligibility(
  '2024-01-15'::DATE,    -- lesson date
  '14:00:00'::TIME,      -- lesson time
  'paid',                -- payment status
  'scheduled'            -- booking status
);
```

### Get Deletion Statistics

```sql
-- Last 30 days
SELECT get_admin_deletion_stats();

-- Custom period
SELECT get_admin_deletion_stats('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31');
```

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Role-Based Access Control

- Only users with `admin` or `tutor` roles can delete bookings
- Authentication required via Supabase session
- Edge function validates user role before processing

### Audit Trail

- Every admin deletion logged in `payment_logs` table
- Includes admin user ID, role, and timestamp
- Tracks refund processing success/failure
- Maintains payment intent IDs for Stripe reconciliation

## üí∞ Refund Processing Details

### Stripe Integration

- Uses `stripe.refunds.create()` API
- Processes full refund amount automatically
- Includes admin metadata for Stripe dashboard tracking
- Handles both immediate and pending refund statuses

### Refund Metadata

```json
{
  "admin_deletion": "true",
  "admin_user_id": "uuid-of-admin",
  "deletion_reason": "Admin/tutor deleted lesson within 24h payment window"
}
```

## üé® User Experience

### Admin Interface

- **Clear Visual Indicators**: Blue notification box shows when deletion will trigger automatic refund
- **Enhanced Confirmations**: Deletion dialog explains refund implications
- **Success Notifications**: Toast messages indicate refund processing status
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages when refund fails but deletion succeeds

### Student Experience

- **Automatic Refunds**: No action required - refund processed automatically
- **Email Notifications**: Future enhancement to notify students of admin-initiated refunds
- **Refund Timing**: Stripe typically processes refunds within 5-10 business days

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Available Queries

**Recent Admin Deletions**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_deletion_summary
ORDER BY deletion_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Monthly Refund Summary**:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', deletion_timestamp) as month,
  COUNT(*) as total_deletions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE refund_processed) as refunded,
  SUM(amount)/100.0 as total_refund_gbp
FROM admin_deletion_summary
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

**Admin Performance**:

```sql
SELECT
  admin_user_id,
  admin_role,
  COUNT(*) as deletions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE refund_processed) as refunds_processed
FROM admin_deletion_summary
GROUP BY admin_user_id, admin_role;
```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Systems

### Payment System Unification

- Uses same timing calculations as student-initiated cancellations
- Leverages existing Stripe payment processing infrastructure

### Booking Management

- Integrates seamlessly with AdminBookingsPage
- Maintains existing filtering and search functionality
- Preserves audit logging consistency

### Cron Job Compatibility

- Admin deletions don't interfere with automatic payment processing
- Edge function operates independently of scheduled jobs
