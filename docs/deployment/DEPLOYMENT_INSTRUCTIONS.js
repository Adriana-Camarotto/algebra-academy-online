/* 
🔧 METADATA LENGTH FIX - DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

The Stripe metadata length error is fixed in the create-payment function.
However, automatic deployment failed.

MANUAL DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:

1. Via Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to Edge Functions
   - Select create-payment function  
   - Copy the updated code from: supabase/functions/create-payment/index.ts
   - Save and deploy

2. Via CLI (if available):
   npx supabase functions deploy create-payment --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

3. Alternative: Create new function version
   - The fix changes metadata from booking_ids.join(",") to safe object structure
   - This prevents the 500+ character metadata that exceeds Stripe's limit

📝 KEY CHANGES MADE:
- Removed long booking_ids string from Stripe metadata
- Added length validation to prevent future errors  
- Maintained essential booking tracking via database relationships
- All booking IDs still linked via payment_intent_id in database

✅ EXPECTED RESULT: 
Recurring bookings will work without metadata length errors.

console.log("🎯 Ready for deployment - metadata length issue resolved!");
